# OOP-Final-Project
Group 7's final project on Go Fish
The game that we have chosen to play is Go Fish! Go Fish is a card game where 7 cards are dealt to each player and the deck includes 52 cards. The rest of the deck is then spread out in the middle, which is called the pool of cards. Also it must be a group of 2, 3, or 4 people. First you start off by asking your opponent if they a specific card. For example, "Do you have any nines?" The card that you're asking for from an opponent should be a card that you have. If the opponent does have the card then they must give it to the person that requested it. But if they don't have the card then they say "Go Fish." When you "Go Fish" that means you take a card from the pool. If the player gets the card requested then they get another turn. The objective of the game is to get the most piles or suits of cards.
